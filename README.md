# CSI3120 Programming Language Concepts - Assignment 2

## Overview
Implement a syntax analyzer for a simplified programming language using a stack data structure. The analyzer should ensure the balanced use of symbols and support basic programming constructs like functions, variables, data types, arithmetic operations, and comments.

## Objectives
- Implement a stack data structure for symbol tracking.
- Ensure balanced parentheses, braces, brackets, and other symbols.
- Support for functions, variables, data types, and arithmetic operations.

## Tasks
1. Implement a stack for symbol tracking.
2. Ensure balanced use of various symbols.
3. Handle functions, variables, and basic data types.
4. Support arithmetic operations and semicolon terminations.

## Challenges
- Stack Implementation.
- Nested Structures.
- Error Reporting.
- Testing and Validation.
